## [Taki Clicker Legacy](/games/updates/taki-clicker-legacy.md)
Taki Clicker is an old game of mine originally made in 5th grade as a joke but became a serious project.
Currently, I am planning on cancelling development on Taki Clicker and rebooting it in Godot Engine as "Toki Clicker" to avoid copyright.
