## [Taki Clicker Legacy](/logs/updates/taki-clicker-legacy.md)
Taki Clicker is an old game I originally made in 5th grade as a joke, but soon became a serious project.
In the fall of 2024, I decided to cancel future development on Taki Clicker and decided to reboot it in Godot Engine as "Toki Clicker" to avoid copyright.
